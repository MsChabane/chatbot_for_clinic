# 🏥 Clinic Chatbot with LangChain + Groq + ChromaDB + Hugging Face Embeddings

This project is a **chatbot powered by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** that answers common questions about a clinic—such as its **name**, **location**, and **working hours**....

It uses:
- **LangChain** for orchestration,
- **Groq** for fast and efficient LLM inference,
- **ChromaDB** as a local vector store,
- **Hugging Face embeddings** for converting clinic documents into vector format for similarity-based retrieval.

## ✨ Features

- 📍 Understands and answers questions about a specific clinic
- 🔎 RAG pipeline: Retrieves relevant info from embedded documents
- ⚡ Fast response powered by **Groq**
- 🧠 Stores document embeddings using **ChromaDB**
- 🧬 Uses **Hugging Face** models to generate embeddings
